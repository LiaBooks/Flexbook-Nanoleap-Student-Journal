**Sole Impression**

**Slide 5**

**Determine the ratio of the contact area of your shoe to the total area. Use the following materials/procedure.**

**Materials:**

* One shoe per group that you do not mind getting dirty
* Tray with finely ground sidewalk chalk, charcoal, or tempera paint with rollers (use a color other than white)
* Graph paper

**Procedure:**

1. Depending on the supplies provided by your teacher, cover the bottom of the shoe with ground up chalk, charcoal, or tempera paint. Make sure that the entire sole of the shoe is covered with the substance.

2. Make an impression with the shoe onto graph paper by pressing the shoe firmly onto the paper.

3. Use the counting-squares method for determining the areas. First, count the total number of squares enclosed by the perimeter of the sole of the shoe. Second, count the number of squares that have sidewalk chalk on it. $^{**}$ **If half or more of the square is covered with chalk, count the square.**$^{**}$

4. Determine the ratio by dividing the amount of the surface covered with chalk (contact area) with the total area of the sole of the shoe. Use the space below for your calculations. Make sure you include units of measure with your calculations.

**Results:**

Set up your ratio:

Contact Area

Total Surface Area

**Collect data for five other groups and use this space to complete a data table comparing the ratios of contact area to total area of various shoes in your class:**

| Student/Group (Name) | Shoe Type (tennis shoe, etc.) | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- |

**Graph Your Comparisons (Ratio of contact to total area vs. Shoe Type)** Be sure to label your graph properly.

![0](media/12.png "Figure 8: 1. Which of the shoes had the highest **contact area to total area ratio?**")

1a. Describe the surface of the shoe.

2. Which of the shoes had the lowest **contact area to total area ratio?**

2a. Describe the surface of the shoe.

2b. How do these results compare with your observations on 2-1 and 2-2.

3. If you included all the soles’ nooks and crannies, which shoe would probably have the most **total surface area?** (NOT RATIO!)

4. What type of sole material (soft or hard) could come into the most contact with the total surface? Why?

5. Based on your examination of different shoe soles, what are your ideas about the surface of a gecko’s foot, and what makes you think that way?

**What Is Nanotechnology? Essay Assessment**

**Directions:**

While many people have heard of “nanotechnology,” how many can explain exactly what it is or give an example of nanotechnology in our everyday lives? Based on what you have learned in this module so far and incorporating what you learn about specific applications of nanotechnology from readings and some Internet resources, you will write a short essay (no more than one typed page) that enlightens your audience about nanotechnology. Be sure your essay fully addresses the writing prompt below. You may refer to your journal to help you plan your response; however, the writing in the essays should be distinct from your journal and be written in your own words (i.e., no copying).

**Writing Prompt**

Explain the term “nanotechnology” to someone who has heard of it only on T.V. Then, explain how scientists and the general public should react to the latest research and applications in nanotechnology.

* Define Nanotechnology.
* Give examples of specific nanoapplications to help illustrate nanotechnology. These should come from the Internet resources you read as well as from what you have learned in this unit.
* Describe nanotechnology’s impact on science and how the application involves research from many different science subjects (e.g., biology, chemistry, physics, engineering).
* Explain why it is important for scientists to discuss the technology’s positive and negative impacts with each other and with the general public.
* Include an explanation for why the general public should stay informed about the progress of nanotechnology.

Refer to the instructional rubric below to learn of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your writing.

**Title:** **Observing Tape**

**Date:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In this space, either include your actual tape or an illustration of your tape with the bubbles marked.

**How Does the Tape work?**

By definition, an **adhesive** is any material that will be useful in holding two objects together solely by surface contact. For an adhesive to achieve intimate contact with an object, it must have the characteristics of a liquid, which makes it capable of coming into intimate contact with the surface. In use, an adhesive must be able to resist any applied force that attempts to break the bond formed between it and the object to which it was applied. In other words, it will need the properties of a solid.

Adapted from Johnston, J. (2003). _Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes_. Pressure Sensitive Tape Council. Northbrook, Illinois, Page 23.

**Slide 3**

What did you do to ensure that the sticky side of the tape had the most contact with the desk?

| Air pressure is the force from molecules of air hitting a surface.

This forces the suction cup to stick to the surface.<br><br>Gecko force experiments indicate that the same force measurements have occurred when the gecko setae are tested in a vacuum (no air pressure) as in regular air. |     |     |

### 6.1 Investigating Static Forces in Nature: The Mystery of the Gecko

<article>

**Slide 1**

Draw one example of balanced forces and one example of unbalanced forces from your classroom in the boxes below. Use arrows to indicate the direction of the forces. Draw large arrows for large forces and small arrows for small forces.

When an object is sticking to a ceiling, what are the two forces that come into play? In order for the shoe to remain on the ceiling, what must be true about these forces?

Weight of Ant = $0.00004 \;\mathrm{Newtons}$

Draw and label arrows representing the forces on the ant that is on the ceiling on the diagram below. Then, calculate the force required for each ant foot. (Note: Divide total force by six.) Be sure to show correct units.

**We are assuming in this problem that the total force required is equally divided among the six ant feet, and that ONLY the contact between feet and ceiling gives rise to the force**.

![0](media/20.png "Figure 3: **Slide 4**")

Imagine an object that is larger in every dimension and whose mass and volume is ten times larger than an ant.

How many “ant feet” would it take for this imaginary object to remain adhered to the ceiling? Show your calculations below. Be sure to show correct units.

**Slide 5**

Now, apply this calculation for the Tokay Gecko, which has an average weight of 2.2 Newtons. How many “ant feet” would it take for the gecko to remain adhered to the ceiling? Be sure to show correct units.

Write a statement and/or draw pictures that describe the relationship between size (mass) and weight and, therefore, adhesive forces required for an animal to remain on a ceiling.

**Slide 8**

How could one measure the amount of “stickiness” of a piece of tape on a tabletop?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The fundamental assumption in testing for adhesion is that the force that holds the tape in place is the same as the force required to remove it. This is NOT true. The force required to remove the tape is actually a lot greater. Much of the separation force is going to extend the adhesive prior to separation and to bend the backing. However, it is the most practical form of adhesion testing available.”

Adapted from Johnston, J. (2003). _Pressure sensitive adhesive tapes_. Pressure Sensitive Tape Council. Northbrook, Illinois, page 154.

**Experiment: Tape Pull**

**Question**: How does the amount of dirt affect the amount of force required to lift a piece of tape from the tabletop?

**Materials**: transparent tape, duct tape, spring scale, hole punch, metric ruler, protractor

**Procedure Practice:**

Set up your testing apparatus as shown below.

![0](media/21.png "Figure 4: Transparent tape and hole for spring scale")

1. Place some transparent tape onto a desk or lab table so that half of the tape is hanging off the edge.

2. Measure the amount of surface area of tabletop that the tape touches (Area = Length times Width).

Area =

3. Use duct tape to make a reinforced end on the tape that is not touching the tabletop.

4. Use the hole-punch to make a hole through the duct tape and the transparent tape.

5. Place the hook end of the spring scale into the hole.

6. Practice pulling the spring scale to measure the amount of force needed to remove the tape from the tabletop.

7. Record your observations from this practice below.

**Procedure Experiment:**

1. Hypothesis: Write a hypothesis below:

If the amount of dirt on the tape \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (increases or decreases), then the force required to remove the tape \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (increases or decreases).

2. Based on your practice trials:

A. What was the independent variable (variable you were testing)?

B. What was the dependent variable (variable being measured)?

3. Write your procedure (in the box below) for testing the force needed to remove transparent tape from the tabletop with varying amounts of dirt. Be sure to include the proposed amount of dirt for the experiment. How will you vary the amount of dirt? (e.g., clean, somewhat dirty, and very dirty).

4. Remember that you are measuring the effect that the amount of dirt has on the force needed to remove the transparent tape. All other variables should be held constant including the angle of pull, the amount of tape that is in contact with the tabletop, etc. What other variables should be held constant?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5. Record your data in the box below. You should test the same amount of dirt for at least three trials and then determine the average force (in Newtons) that it took to remove the tape from the tabletop. Make sure you make both quantitative (force measurements) and qualitative (notes and drawings) for your data tables.

**Analysis/Interpretation**

6. Based on the information in your data table, write an answer to the original research question above.

**Slide 3**

**Purpose:**

Scientists use probes to identify the properties of objects, even if they cannot see the objects! In this activity, you will use a height probe to identify and analyze the height differences in an object that you cannot see.

**Materials:**

_One set of materials per group of 2–3 students:_

* Observation box
* Height probe: straightened paperclip at least 6 inches long
* $3$ pieces of scan paper (provided) or graph paper
* Thumbtack
* Ruler
* Pen
* Glue-stick
* Scissors

_For the class:_

* Glue gun

**Procedure:**

**Measuring With the Height Probe**

1. How will you measure the height of the object inside the box using a ruler and height probe with different colored marks?

2. Measure the height of the box. Systematically measure the distance from the probe hole to the object for each probe hole. Subtract this distance from the height of the box and **record** your data on the scan area below or on a larger scan paper. These measurements represent the various heights of the object inside the box.

**Slide 4**

**Making a Three-Dimensional Representation of the Objects in Your Box**

1. Open a new spreadsheet in Excel.

2. Select the cells with data. Go to the chart wizard (chart symbol on the toolbar). Choose a surface plot: 2-D or 3-D (try both). Select NEXT at each dialogue box (Don’t worry about labels).

Notes:

* Once you get the chart, you can change the scale of the coloring by double clicking on the legend, going to the scale tab and changing the value for the major unit.
* You can rotate a 3-D chart by clicking on the chart and then dragging the corner dots.

**Analyzing Your Data**

1. Look at the 3-D representation you have created. Describe your object based upon your 3-D representation. Do you see any pattern in the numbers that gives a clue to the structure of the object inside the box? What does it look like?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2. Optional: Open your box and compare to the graph you just created.

3. Optional: Print and staple your graph to this journal page.

**Activity: Modeling an AFM with a Refrigerator Magnet**

**Procedure:**

Use a refrigerator magnet to simulate and AFM probing a surface. The magnetic probe strip represents the scanning probe tip of an AFM. The refrigerator magnet represents a nanoparticle sample.

![0](media/23.png "Figure 1: 1. Drag the probe strip across the surface of the magnet, and notice any deflections. You will need to hold the probe strip nearly horizontal to the surface. Probe the magnet on various sides and in various directions.")

2. As you know, the north pole of a magnet will attract the south pole of another magnet, and two magnets with either their north poles or their south poles pointed at each other will repel.

3. With this in mind, draw a representation of the magnetic poles in the box below.

* Be sure to include the number of up and down deflections that you observe as you

probe your “nanoparticle.”

* What is the distance between the up and down deflections?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

* Are these distances uniform all the way across the surface, and in all directions?

Write a short essay in response to the prompt below. Base your essay on what you have learned about gecko adhesion throughout the module. You may refer to your journal to help you plan your response; however, the writing in the essay should be distinct from your journal and be written in your own words (i.e., no copying). Your response to the prompt should not exceed one page. You may use diagrams to illustrate concepts; however, the diagrams should reinforce your written explanations not replace them.

**Writing Prompt**

Explain how the gecko can adhere to a ceiling. Your written explanation should include the following:

* Describe (with words and/or drawings) the surface-to-surface interactions between gecko “setae” and a ceiling. Be sure to address the characteristics of both the setae and the surface. Include the shape, number, and size of setae in contact with the surface.
* Describe the variables affecting adhesion: the surface area, the surface contact, and the type of surface.
* Explain how a lot of tiny adhesive forces overcome the force of gravity.
* Describe the electrical forces and their role in gecko adhesion (i.e., interactions of charged particles between atoms of the spatula and the ceiling surface).

Refer to the instructional rubric on the next page to learn of the criteria that will be used to evaluate your writing.
